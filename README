Introduction
============

This is a Chinese word segment programme based on MMSEG (Maximum
Matching SEGment) algorithm:
    Tsai, C. H. (1996). MMSEG: A Word Identification System for
    Mandarin Chinese Text Based on Two Variations of the Maximum
    Matching Algorithm. Unpublished manuscript, University of
    Illinois at Urbana-Champain.
Only the first three rules are applied, which are grammar based
rules. The last rule was cut off, that is a statistic related
rule which pre-learning is needed. By the way, the contribution
of the last rule is not very significant. For real time purpose,
a Trie Tree algorithm was introduced to produce a whole sequence
of prefix matching. As tested on my laptop, more than 4MB/s text
were processed.

Install
=======

The default install prefix is /usr/local which was defined in
Makefile, if you want intall the programme to other location,
edit makefile and change the variable PREFIX. As a simplified
project, there is no configure, so only two steps to install:

  # make
  # make install

You'd better have the root privilege to run above steps,
otherwise change a PREFIX that you have the right to write.
This will install a simple app ``seg'' to /usr/local/bin and
two word lists file to /usr/local/lib/. After installing,
you can run the programme as:

  # seg < demo.big5.txt

Make sure your terminal supported what you processed, or
redirect the output to a file and view the result using other
viewers. If you want to show the process time (i.e. verbose
mode) and using other dictionary, then:

  # seg -v -d /where/other/dictionary < demo.big5.txt

The format of the dictionary file is simple, just one line
one word. Big5 and GB2312 charsets are supported now. Of
cause, big5 dictionary for big5 text and gb2312 dictionary
for gb2312 text.
